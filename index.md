Improved the security of the API's authentication system allowing users to go through a reliable password reset flow that didn't expose any user-critical information that can

Engineered, developed, led and scaled the integration between Pricemoov - a SaaS to manage product pricing - and the company‚Äôs monolithic API, allowing pricing managers to strategize and modify rates for vehicle fleets and dealership locations through the Pricemoov interface, while having all this pricing data seamlessly synchronize with the business's Rental app.

Audited the monolithic API's endpoints for unsanitized error responses, exposing SQL queries being used by the internal implementations of said endpoints and business logic. Built an error sanitizer that ensured no raw SQL queries are being exposed regardless of the origin or type of exceptional states being raised by the monolith, further improving its security and reducing vulnerability to malicious intents.
