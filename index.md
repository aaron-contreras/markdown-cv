`2021-now`

__Projects__

üöò ___Dealerware___ - Car dealership SaaS

[Live App](https://audiondemand.com)

Improved the security of the API's authentication system allowing users to go through a reliable password reset flow that didn't expose any user-critical information that can
be leveraged during an exploit.

Enhanced the CI/CD pipeline to reduce the average time spent in code review by 65% and reduced the number of regression bugs introduced at a rate close to 98%.

Engineered, developed, led and scaled the integration between Pricemoov - a SaaS to manage product pricing - and the company‚Äôs monolithic API, allowing pricing managers to strategize and modify rates for vehicle fleets and dealership locations through the Pricemoov interface, while having all this pricing data seamlessly synchronize with the business's Rental app.

Audited the monolithic API's endpoints for unsanitized error responses, exposing SQL queries being used by its internal workings. Following this, built an error sanitizer that ensured no sensitive information that may be leveraged by individuals with malicious intent is being exposed in responses, further improving the system's security.

Co-led, planned, designed and developed a Long Term Rental Flow initiative, allowing customers to book vehicles on a long term basis, alongside the company's already exisiting booking flow.
